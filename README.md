# Homework 19: Employee/User Directory

## Description
This repository holds the homework assignment for Week 19 of the [The Coding Boot Camp](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/) through the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Professional Education.

The scope of this project is to create an employee/user directory that has sorting and filtering functionality. This application is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and required us to use components within the UI, manage the component state, as well as respond to user events.

## Notes
This application uses the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to populate a table of "employees" that shows their headshot, name, phone number, email, and state of residence.

## Instructions
This project can be opened and run in multiple ways.
- You can use this application [here](https://ryanrotman.github.io/homework-19-user-directory/).
- You can also clone or fork this application from this [repository](https://github.com/ryanrotman/homework-19-user-directory) and then open it in your text editor of choice. You will also need access to a CLI. This project was created using VSCode and then run in the integrated terminal. Then run ```npm run start``` to launch the application.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
